# senior-thesis-hartog

This github repository contains the code I used to run the simulations in Section 3 of my thesis, as well as the .tex file and images used in the thesis write-up.

The code uses the numpy, matplotlib, time, random, scipy, and sklearn modules. The code is contained in the file 'hartog_thesis_code.ipynb'.

The tex file containing my thesis is called 'main.tex'

Please contact whartog@college.harvard.edu with any questions, or if something looks off.
